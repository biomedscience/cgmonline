# 摘要

The plant immune system involves cell-surface receptors that detect intercellular pathogen-derived molecules, and intracellular receptors that activate immunity upon detection of pathogen-secreted effector proteins that act inside the plant cell. Immunity mediated by surface receptors has been extensively studied, but that mediated by intracellular receptors has rarely been investigated in the absence of surface-receptor-mediated immunity. Furthermore, interactions between these two immune pathways are poorly understood. Here, by activating intracellular receptors without inducing surface-receptor-mediated immunity, we analyse interactions between these two distinct immune systems in Arabidopsis. Pathogen recognition by surface receptors activates multiple protein kinases and NADPH oxidases, and we find that intracellular receptors primarily potentiate the activation of these proteins by increasing their abundance through several mechanisms. Likewise, the hypersensitive response that depends on intracellular receptors is strongly enhanced by the activation of surface receptors. Activation of either immune system alone is insufficient to provide effective resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Thus, immune pathways activated by cell-surface and intracellular receptors in plants mutually potentiate to activate strong defences against pathogens. These findings reshape our understanding of plant immunity and have broad implications for crop improvement.
